Rent-o-matic
============

A demo implementation of a clean architecture in Python.

The goal of the "Rent-o-matic" project (fans of Day of the Tentacle may
get the reference) is to create a simple search engine on top of a
dataset of objects which are described by some quantities. The search
engine shall allow to set some filters to narrow the search.

The objects in the dataset are storage rooms for rent described by the
following quantities:

-  An unique identifier
-  A size in square meters
-  A renting price in Euro/day
-  Latitude and longitude

The project is explained in detail and developed step-by-step in this
post `Clean architectures in Python: a step-by-step
example <https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/>`__.

This package was created with
`Cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`__ and my
`Python project
template <https://github.com/lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage>`__
